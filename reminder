For improved performance:
    train you model with larger data.
    Alter the data augmentation parameters. 
    Batch normalisation can be done to perform better.
    Increase the epochs and batch_size during the training 
    Modify the space of dataset by including all genders, night conditions, various backgrounds ( test background should be included)
    Retrain the model after such changes.
    Always load the latest model in the script.
For testing:
    Keep the face stable for detection.
    The face should be well-light for optimum results.
    Stay at a distance of 70 cm (arms length) in front the camera.
    Move slightly closer or farther if not detected in 5 seconds.
