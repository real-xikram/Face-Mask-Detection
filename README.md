# Face-Mask-Detection
Convolution Neural Network based face mask identification application for devices with python.

#The Dataset
https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-face-mask-data/

# Highligths of the Project:
  -This is an end-to-end deep learning model for detection of people wearing face mask in real-time videos using Keras network          architecture.
  -Techniques of Data Augmentation are used to build a CNN with filter kernels ,max pooling layers and dropouts to reduce        overfitting, fully connected layers  and a sigmoid layer for output
  - Model is trained using Adam Optimization using the Binary Cross Entropy loss function and the measure for evaluation is accuracy
  - Model acheives 99.51 % accuracy on validation dataset and and can be imported in the test.py files and is used for detection.


# Common Debugging:
1. Check the loaded model name and check if it is present in the current directory.
2. Check if the datasets are loaded in the trainging notebook are in the current directory.
2. Download and import necessary modules.
